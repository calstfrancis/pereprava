# setup-release-secrets.sh — one-shot setup of the three release-flatpak.yml secrets
#
# Cal-only. Wraps the three `gh secret set` calls from RELEASE-CI-SETUP.md into one
# script so this is one command instead of three to remember. Safe to re-run any time —
# `gh secret set` overwrites in place.
#
# The GPG key/passphrase are the same across every app in the suite (one shared signing
# key) and the repo token is scoped to calstfrancis/flatpak, not to whichever app-repo
# it's stored under — so if you already have this token from setting up another app
# (Zerkalo, Kartoteka), paste that same value instead of minting a new one.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup-release-secrets.sh
